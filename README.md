# Creality-Box-Upload
Python script that automatically uploads code to crealitycloud.com

To use the script you will need an installation of python 3 and you will have to have the required libraries installed.
Use Terminal or Command Prompt or whatever command-line emulator you use on your computer to install Selenium.

Go through the python file and customise as needs be.
For Mac you can use an automator quick action to just rightclick on the saved gcode files.
For other devices you will need to run the python script with the file input window.

For Mac Automator python needs to be installed in your bash_profile folder. If you get a "python command not found" error when trying to run the quick action run the following command in terminal: echo "alias python=/usr/bin/python3" >> ~/.bash_profile
